This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus\' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from Arabian Nights and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems.

Approximately one third of the texts are oral in origin, and few have previously been available in book form.', 560, '2002-01-01 00:00:00', 'Places - Literary Anthologies, African Literature Anthologies, General & Miscellaneous African History, Women\'s History - Africa, Sub-Saharan', 'An essential text for libraries&#151;the definitive collection of women\'s literatures from southern Africa.Library JournalThis rich resource for scholars and general readers alike is the product of a decade of research by the Women Writing Africa Project. The project, funded by the Ford and Rockefeller foundations, seeks to bring African women\'s literary voices to the public through four volumes of texts arranged by region. The first volume in this distinctive series presents 120 southern African texts that are rich, evocative, and shaped by endless complexities. The settler colonies, such as Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, offer the largest body of research materials to be mined. Botswana\'s lack of colonialism meant that literacy came at a later date than in other countries, so texts are available only from the mid-1920s. Lesotho has older texts, however, owing to the presence of a Christian mission. Spanning two centuries (the 19th and the 20th) and featuring such writers as Tsitsi Dangarembga, Nadine Gordimer, Lauretta Ngcobo, Doris Lessing, and Winnie Mandela, the anthology includes texts that range from songs, poems, fiction, praise poems, and folktales to letters, journals, historical documents, journalism pieces, and oral testimonies. The volume\'s editors, all South African scholars, have also included a journal by a Boer woman written during the Anglo-Boer War, a testimony before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and songs of female initiation into adulthood. These selections, most of which have never before been assembled or published, often call into question such important matters as borders, language, vocabulary, translation, and colonialism. The lengthy introduction adequately explicates the historical as well as textual meaning, and each text\'s headnote provides context and useful details about the date of its origin, location, and language.

To find out why there are so many \"suffocated hearts and tortured souls\" in this literature, Valerie Orlando, who has long studied Francophone text and culture, here closely reads the work of Aminata Sow Fall, Mariama B�, Myrian Warner-Vieyra, and Simone Schwarz-Bart, among others. In these women\'s novels, Orlando finds, madness is the manifestation of a split identity, and in this study she sets herself the task of interrogating the nature of that identity. Francophone women novelists of Africa and the Caribbean�though they come from countries whose unique experiences of colonialism, revolution, and postcolonial regimes have shaped specific and discrete cultures�express a common search for a meaningful relationship between their experience as women to the history and destiny of their nations. Only when \"woman\"\' is understood not as an ahistorical object but as a subject whose lived body is entwined with political, cultural, and economic structures, Orlando argues, will insanity finally give way to clarity of being.

This study offers a radical new position for those scholars who have long sought alternatives to the liberal humanist bias pervading many studies of African women\'s writing.Students often struggle with the models employed by feminist and postcolonial theorists such as Judith Butler and Homi Bhabha. The clarity with which Harrow explains the positions of such theorists makes his book an essential companion to, and commentary upon, their publications.

This revised edition includes a foreword by Effie Lee Morris, along with the original foreword by W. E. B. Du Bois. Together they provide an appreciation of the work of Lorenz Graham and his classic book.(Booklist) - Hazel RochmanThe son of an African Methodist Episcopal minister in California, Graham taught in a missionary school in Liberia in the 1920s. He wrote this collection of biblical story-poems, which he published in 1946, in the voices of West African teachers and students. Now the collection has been reissued in a handsome volume with dramatic, new, full-page block prints by Ashley Bryan. The stories, great for reading aloud, have the simplicity and rhythm of the oral tradition. Both colloquial and poetic, they bring the holy into daily life. There\'s Noah (\"God Wash the World and Start Again\"), Solomon (\"Wise Sword Find True Mommy\"), Ruth, Samson, and many others. There are also a few selections from the New Testament, among them, \"Make glad all people / God\'s pican be born in Bethlehem.\" The word pican, with its racist associations to picaninny, may be a problem with some readers, but as Graham explains in his introduction, the original word, meaning baby, son, or child, was used with great tenderness up and down the West African coast. It would be a shame to deprive today\'s children of this newly illustrated collection, endorsed by leading black authors, educators, and political leaders, because of the occasional use of this word. Most beautiful is the story of the Prodigal Son, told with a dramatic simplicity that\'s just right for readers\' theater: the wastrel son\'s return and celebration, the good son\'s complaint to his father (\"I work, I work, I work, I never left you. All the time you never kill one small goat for me. How you do me so?\"), and the moving reply (\"He was dead and now he live. He ain\'t got nothin. And he hungry\").

Such are some of the story lines to be found within the pages of An Anthology of Interracial Literature. This is the first anthology to explore the literary theme of black-white encounters, of love and family stories that cross&#151;or are crossed by&#151;what came to be considered racial boundaries. The anthology extends from Cleobolus\' ancient Greek riddle to tormented encounters in the modern United States, visiting along the way a German medieval chivalric romance, excerpts from Arabian Nights and Italian Renaissance novellas, scenes and plays from Spain, Denmark, England, and the United States, as well as essays, autobiographical sketches, and numerous poems.

The authors included range from Hans Christian Andersen and Alexander Pushkin to Eugene O\'Neill and Gwendolyn Brooks.

Lehman devotes much of his introduction to throwing jabs at longtime sparring partner and professional poetry grump William Logan, whom Lehman calls &ldquo;wounded&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin skinned.&rdquo; Guest editor Wagoner chooses to abstain from the scuffle, but there\'s no denying the aesthetic character amassed by the poems he\'s selected&#58; American poets not only want to talk about their country this year, they want to talk violence in (and toward) their country. &ldquo;They came to blow up America,&rdquo; writes John Ashbery, followed hard on his heels by Mark Bibbins, who warns our fifth state, &ldquo;Connecticut! we\'re sawing you in half.&rdquo; Denise Duhamel envisions &ldquo;How It Will End&rdquo; (&ldquo;We look around, but no one is watching us&rdquo;) and Rob Cook, in his bold and incantatory &ldquo;Song of America,&rdquo; tells us, &ldquo;I\'m raising my child to drown and drop dead and to carry buildings on his back.&rdquo; It appears our poets are at last ready to confront the hysteria and violence of the past eight years, and who can say there\'s a better year than 2009 to begin.

Scott Fitzgerald, Eudora Welty, Flannery O\'Connor, Saul Bellow, and John Updike have among them written hundreds of short stories, do anthologists settle on the same two or three titles by each author again and again? \"Isn\'t the implicit promise of an anthology that it will, or aspires to, present something different, unexpected?\" In The Oxford Book of American Short Stories, Joyce Carol Oates offers a sweeping survey of American short fiction, in a collection of fifty-six tales that combines classic works with many \"different, unexpected\" gems, and that invites readers to explore a wealth of important pieces by women and minority writers. Some selections simply can\'t be improved on, Oates admits, and she happily includes such time-honored works as Irving\'s \"Rip Van Winkle,\" Poe\'s \"The Tell-Tale Heart,\" and Hemingway\'s \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\" But alongside these classics, Oates introduces such little-known stories as Mark Twain\'s \"Cannibalism in the Cars,\" a story that reveals a darker side to his humor (\"That morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to...a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy\"). From Melville come the juxtaposed tales \"The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids,\" of which Oates says, \"Only Melville could have fashioned out of \'real\' events...such harrowing and dreamlike allegorical fiction.\" From Flannery O\'Connor we find \"A Late Encounter With the Enemy,\" and from John Cheever, \"The Death of Justina,\" one of Cheever\'s own favorites, though rarely anthologized. The reader will also delight in the range of authors found here, from Charles W. Chesnutt, Jean Toomer, and Sarah Orne Jewett, to William Carlos Williams, Kate Chopin, and Zora Neale Hurston. Contemporary artists abound, including Bharati Mukherjee and Amy Tan, Alice Adams and David Leavitt, Bobbie Ann Mason and Tim O\'Brien, Louise Erdrich and John Edgar Wideman. Oates provides fascinating introductions to each writer, blending biographical information with her own trenchant observations about their work, plus a long introductory essay, in which she offers the fruit of years of reflection on a genre in which she herself is a master. This then is a book of surprises, a fascinating portrait of American short fiction, as filtered through the sensibility of a major modern writer.Library JournalIn these lean times, it is difficult to imagine many libraries champing at the bit to purchase yet another anthology of American short stories. But institutions seeking to expand the diversity of their holdings in this area may find this collection the perfect choice. ``Familiar names, unfamiliar titles\'\' is the raison d\'etre for this new volume. Along with some old chestnuts such as ``The Tell-Tale Heart\'\' and ``A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,\'\' editor Oates presents many fresh selections such as Edith Wharton\'s ``The Journey\'\' and John Cheever\'s ``The Death of Justina.\'\' She includes lesser-known minority and women writers such as Jean Toomer and Mary E. Wilkins Freeman alongside stories by newcomers Amy Tan, Louise Erdrich, and David Leavitt. Each author is given a brief biographical introduction.

Who they have become is clear both in self-awareness and what they do with their lives teaching others, advocacy, computer work, construction in prison and out. It is in this change that hope resides; lying next to and rising out of despair, hope permeates the book. Why, in the end, does Lamb want us to care about 10 women in prison?

Never attempting to capture or replicate a single, authentic \"American identity,\" this collection succeeds by producing a comprehensive and multifaceted look at what America has been and, by extension, what it is and might become. While it\'s not explicitly political, the volume\'s multicultural intentions are visible. Beginning with \"Cone-pone Opinions,\" a 1901 Mark Twain essay that uses the wisdom of an African-American child as its central image, Oates has fashioned a collection that calls attention to the way that \"America\" is made up of competing, and often antagonistic, cultural and social visions. There is not only the apparent contrast between the populist, overtly political visions of W.E.B. Du Bois\'s \"Of the Coming of John,\" James Baldwin\'s \"Notes of a Native Son\" and Mary McCarthy\'s \"Artists in Uniform\" and the cultural elitism of T.S. Eliot\'s \"Tradition and the Individual Talent.\" Oates has managed to find numerous pieces whose vision and philosophy resonate with one another without becoming homogeneous, so Gretel Ehrlich\'s meditation on pastoral aesthetics in \"The Solace of Open Spaces\" contrasts abruptly and ingeniously with Susan Sontag\'s urban-centered \"Notes on Camp.\" In all, Oates has assembled a provocative collection of masterpieces reflecting both the fragmentation and surprising cohesiveness of various American identities.

Former New York Times Book Review poetry editor Schmidt calls the laureates \"the gatekeepers of the American idiom,\" and above all, that\'s what a reader will find here&#58; a good sampling of what the mainstream of American poetry has to offer--the careful descriptions of Bishop, the powerful critiques of Brooks, the surreal landscapes of Simic, Merwin\'s deep images, Bogan\'s careful stanzas, Lowell\'s blustery lines.

Medina\'s and Rivera\'s emphasis is on the poem and its subject matter, not the poet, which makes for a remarkably democratic anthology. Every poet has about the same page and a half of space. The book\'s design puts the poets\' names in a very small type. None of the big names June Jordan, Reg E. Gaines, Edwin Torres, Wanda Coleman, Patricia Smith and Amiri Baraka are given more attention than the less published. Organized by subjects such as \"Blood, I Say, Study our Story, Sing this Song,\" \"Drums Drown Out Our Sorrow\" and \"Seeds of Resistance,\" most of the poems use urban imagery, tough talk and declaration. Most are identity-centered, anti-racist and pro-activist. Many focus on current events. There are, for instance, at least four poems about Amadou Diallo, the unarmed Ghanaian immigrant killed by New York policemen as he stood in his doorway. All mention the 41 shots; all include the word \"mother.\" There are poems about Shaka Sankofa (convicted of murder at 17, and executed nearly 20 years later under Texas\'s then-Governor George W. Bush), and homages to Cuban bandleader Tito Puente. Some readers will wish for more variation of theme and for more layered meanings, but the topicality and directness of the poems make this an ideal textbook for introductory poetry classes, especially for urban high school students, and for anyone interestedin poetry as a social art.

The editors of this overstuffed anthology never quite get around to defining just what \"outlaw literature\" is and what makes it illicit, dangerous, or otherwise suspect, except to hint that it stands in some sort of opposition to the world of \"reality shows, Botox, or IPOs,\" to say nothing of a \"culture coming of age in the grip of Google and Wal-mart.\" Resounding sentiments, those, and the editors, famed counterculturists in their own right, presumably know outlaw literature when they see it. Still, you might wonder: What do Richard Brautigan and Mickey Spillane, who took home hefty advances and even heftier royalty checks, really have in common with, say, Boxcar Bertha and Sonny Barger? Would Emma Goldman have much to say to Valerie Solanas, Ray Bradbury to DMX? Only a deconstructionist, perhaps, could say with any authority. For our purposes, being an outlaw writer appears mostly to mean using lots of naughty words (Barry Gifford: \"Willie Wild Wong, you dumb motherfucker!\"; Jim Carroll: \"\'I am the proletariat, you dumb bastard,\' he said, \'and I think those motherfuckers are off their rockers\") and doing lots of naughty and unhealthful things (Norman Mailer: \"I threw up a little while ago and my breath is foul\"; William Burroughs: \"Junk sickness, suspended by codeine and hop, numbed by weeks of constant drinking, came back on me full force\"). Still, there are lots of good and memorable things here, among them Paul Krassner\'s memoir of dropping acid with Groucho Marx; Dee Dee Ramone\'s heartfelt plea, \"Please don\'t kill me now, God. I would love to be the last Ramone to die\" (no such luck, sorry); and MalcolmX\'s spot-on prediction that after his death \"the white man, in his press, is going to identify me with \'hate.\'\" A freeform category, then, marked by a rather shapeless but still quite readable, collection.

Hartman, an eloquent, middle-aged prisoner convicted of murder at 19, tells a sad but unsentimental story: a rough childhood and a wish for invincibility fueled Hartman\'s youth and downfall, but in the time since, he has married in prison, fathered a child, and currently works to improve the broken U.S. prison system.

This new edition�including a new introduction and three new essays�remains a testament of Moraga\'s coming-of-age as a Chicana and a lesbian at a time when the political merging of those two identities was severely censured. Drawing on the Mexican legacy of Malinche, the symbolic mother of the first mestizo peoples, Moraga examines the collective sexual and cultural wounding suffered by women since the Conquest. Moraga examines her own mestiza parentage and the seemingly inescapable choice of assimilation into a passionless whiteness or uncritical acquiescence to the patriarchal Chicano culture she was raised to reproduce. By finding Chicana feminism and honoring her own sexuality and loyalty to other women of color, Moraga finds a way to claim both her family and her freedom. Moraga\'s new essays, written with a voice nearly a generation older, continue the project of \"loving in the war years,\" but Moraga\'s posture is now closer to that of a zen warrior than a street-fighter.

What is my heart like, am I kind, strong, loving, compassionate. . . . Those are the things that count.\" I Am Not My Breast Cancer gathers the warm, loving, frank, and informed voices of more than 800 women-from every state in the nation and from continents as far away as Australia and Africa-who reveal their fears, trade advice, share experiences, and express their deepest, most intimate concerns. Nothing before this groundbreaking book has captured the real experience of breast cancer. It is essential reading for any woman with this diagnosis. I Am Not My Breast Cancer offers women the companionship of other women dealing with this disease. Ruth Peltason, who has twice undergone treatment for breast cancer, has woven their stories together while maintaining the authenticity of their voices. These are ordinary women dealing with this cancer and its many ramifications. They range in age from their early twenties to their late seventies. They are the collective face of breast cancer today. Their comments are moving, sometimes funny, always honest. They speak out on every topic, from lovemaking and intimacy to losing their hair, from juggling the day-to-day realities of being a patient, mother, wife, and coworker to the overwhelming worries about their own mortality. Remarkably, they emerge with grace and optimism and a determination not to be defined by disease. Taking the reader chronologically through the stages of diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and self-discovery, I Am Not My Breast Cancer offers women a deeper understanding of themselves and living with cancer. As Peltason writes inher introduction, \"My greatest wish for this book is that it offer comfort to any woman living with breast cancer and to those who care about her. If this book is kept on the bedside table, then I hope its need is brief and its impact lasting. I Am Not My Breast Cancer speaks of courage, heroism in deeds small and large, and incredible faith and fortitude.\" \"You can live without a breast. You cannot say the same for the human heart.\"Publishers WeeklyPeltason, an editor and breast cancer survivor, founded and hosted the \"First Person Plural\" Web site project, an online forum for women facing the disease. Their dialogue provides the content for this book, culled from the entries of 800 women across the U.S. and around the world. Peltason organizes the material into three general parts: \"Diagnosis,\" \"Living with Breast Cancer\" and \"The Big Picture,\" with such subtopics as \"Sharing the News,\" \"Being Womanly\" and \"Anniversaries and Milestones.\" Participants use screen names for privacy, approaching their disease with candor and freely discussing their feelings about their bodies and their relationships. At times, those overcome by anger and fear far outweigh those with a bright outlook, but when these survivors \"look in the mirror\" at the conclusion of the text, many envision a hopeful future. Perhaps the most poignant entries are from younger women, some of whom have been driven into early menopause and infertility by chemotherapy. Although this is an informative book, some survivors may discover that these raw entries churn up disturbing emotions; others will find comfort in these voices, and in the knowledge that they aren\'t alone-either in their sorrow or in their strength and courage.

Not for the squeamish, Sapphire\'s imagery is so fierce that readers will want to spread out the book over several sittings. Accounts of a young girl\'s rape by her father frame and inform all else, but Sapphire draws in irony as a buffer: in one extremely vivid poem, familiar phrases from the Mickey Mouse Club alternate with memories of assault. Early in her career, this writer felt the need to tell the stories of all victims (Tawana Brawley, the Central Park jogger, a nameless woman she meets on the bus), but to accomplish this she must adopt their emotional horrors as her own. ``Now that you know, / you can begin / to heal,\'\' the first poem ends. It is this commitment to human sensitivity that makes the terrifying exploits described here palatable. It also permits the narrator, 80 pages later, to describe the grief she feels at her mother\'s deathbed.

They spoke with amused intelligence, compassion, and dispassion.\"Publishers WeeklyMoore takes a tried and true tack in this current edition of the popular series, choosing solid stories that rely more on careful character development and seamless writing than on inventiveness or stylistic flash. The results are occasionally stodgy, but there are plenty of satisfying entries, if few startling ones. Family relations are a recurring theme, and two stories of note unearth family ghosts. In John Edgar Wideman\'s \"What We Cannot Speak About We Must Pass Over in Silence,\" a man is enmeshed in the life of his deceased friend\'s jailed son; in Trudy Lewis\'s \"Limestone Diner,\" a grandmother comes to terms with her past through the tragic accident of a local girl. Most stories are firmly rooted in the U.S., but a few roam cautiously afield. In \"The Tutor,\" set in India, Nell Freudenberger explores the dynamics of an expatriate father and daughter relationship; \"Mirror Studies\" by Mary Yukari Waters takes place in Japan and interestingly weaves in monkey studies. The selection favors well-known writers, including Alice Munro, Annie Proulx and John Updike, and some readers may wish for a more varied lineup-the New Yorker is the source of eight of the 20 entries-but there\'s no arguing with the power of most of these offerings by the heavy hitters of the contemporary canon.

One publication cultivating many of New York City\'s greatest stories is the City section in The New York Times. Each Sunday, this section of The New York Times, distributed only in papers in the five boroughs, captivates readers with tales of people and places that make the city unique. Featuring a cast of stellar writers�Phillip Lopate, Vivian Gornick, Thomas Beller and Laura Shaine Cunningham, among others�New York Stories brings some of the best essays from the City section to readers around the country. New Yorkers can learn something new about their city, while other readers will enjoy the flavor of the Big Apple. New York Stories profiles people like sixteen-year-old Barbara Ott, who surfs the waters off Rockaway in Queens, and Sonny Payne, the beloved panhandler of the F train. Other essays explore memorable places in the city, from the Greenwich Village townhouse blown up by radical activists in the 1970s to a basketball court that serves as the heart of its Downtown neighborhood. The forty essays collected in New York Stories reflect an intimate understanding of the city, one that goes beyond the headlines.

Rosenblum, who edits the City section, has collected 40 representative pieces that showcase the ups and downs of life in a metropolis that still exerts a gravitational pull on those seeking their fortune. Many of the essays are by well-known authors, such as Jan Morris, Phillip Lopate and Vivian Gornick, but others, equally winning, are by emerging writers. All of the pieces are engrossing and share a painstaking attention to craft. Mel Gussow dramatically evokes the day in 1970 when the Greenwich Village townhouse next door to him, occupied by members of the radical Weather Underground, was blown apart in an accidental detonation in their basement bomb factory. On a lighter note, Tara Bahrampour recounts the paradigmatic New York experience: searching for an affordable apartment. Field Maloney and Jill Eisenstadt each relate the glory days of Queens\'s Rockaway Beach as a summer resort, its sad decline and enduring allure. This is both an excellent addition to New York history and a pleasure for casual browsing. B&w photos.

Editor Garc a (Dreaming in Cuban) contends that the border has shaped artistic expression on both sides; these selections suggest the frustration Latinos face as they ambulate between two cultures. Gloria Anzald a\'s \"How To Tame a Wild Tongue\" describes the bilingual acrobatics executed by many Latinos, Rub n Mart nez\'s \"Crossing Over\" narrates the travails of the border, and Richard Rodriguez\'s \"India\" offers an unflinching view on the issue of miscegenation. Of equal importance, however, is the Mexican literature that preceded contemporary Latino writing. For this reason, Garc a includes selections from distinguished Mexican writers (e.g., Rulfo, Paz, Poniatowska, Monsiv is, Fuentes, and many others) whose work has both reflected and influenced the Mexican psyche. In this sense, the book serves as an important sampling of Mexico\'s best authors. Although similar to the recent Mexico: A Traveler\'s Literary Companion, which helps the traveler understand Mexico, this new work helps Mexico and the United States understand the traveler from and between these two worlds.

These and many more intensely intimate memories make Dream Me Home Safely a collection as diverse and powerful as all of American letters.Publishers WeeklyIn today\'s diverse society, it\'s no longer possible for an individual voice to capture a singular American view of childhood. Dissimilar experiences can each sound uniquely American, such as the stability of Patricia Elam\'s refreshingly functional family, in which \"the only thing that distinguished us from the families on Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It to Beaver, and Father Knows Best... was our brown skin\"; the quiet confusion of Michael Patrick MacDonald, who \"decided that `normal\' certainly meant something somewhere out there, beyond... where we lived\"; or the poignant isolation of Nina Revoyr as the only Japanese child in Marshfield, Wis. This collection successfully gathers many voices, completing an impassioned picture of growing up in America. Thirty-four authors, including Chang-rae Lee, Alice Walker and John Edgar Wideman, lyrically portray their younger years. Each piece-whether describing the bluffs of Illinois, the movie houses of Paris, Tex., or Christmas in Alabama-illustrate how childhood informs adulthood. As Lisa Page writes, as we age, \"the child remains, transcended, often denied, but there all the same, hiding beneath our business suits, our corporate uniforms, the camouflage we wear to communicate our grown-up selves.\" While most essays are magical, a few are forced and the flow of the anthology suffers from its alphabetical, rather than thematic, organization. But these are easily overlooked flaws in this beautiful compilation that proves that \"childhood, of course, never ends.\" (Oct. 22) Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information.', 'Dream Me Home Safely: Writers on Growing Up in America', 'dream-me-home-safely'),

Most of these writers fled political instability as children and describe the dual reality of alienation from yetbelonging to two worlds, forging an identity separate from that of their parents in the new country, while at the same time continuing to wait for stability in the old country. Nik l Payen tells of her experience as a U.S. Justice Department-sponsored interpreter who uses her knowledge of Krey l (\"the language whose purpose in life up until now had been to pain and confuse me\") as \"an asset\" to translate for refugees waiting in horrific conditions at Guantanamo Naval Base following the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. When she witnesses the return of some of these Haitians--denied entrance to the U.S.--she likens their journey to the African Middle Passage. In another, Marie-H l ne Laforest, whose lighter skin color and family\'s wealth made her \"white\" in Haiti, realizes that she is simply black in America and later forges a third identity in Italy. Francie Latour, a journalist, convinces her American newspaper to send her to Haiti with a noble aim, but ends up \"hitting a cultural wall\" and being viewed as a \"traitor\" by her native people.

Jeanne Marie Laskas s G-L-O-R-Y! offers a rousing inside look at the pregame rituals of the Cincinnati Bengals cheerleaders. A riveting online diary by Wright Thompson reveals a bleak and merciless landscape in China, which that country s government would rather not have the world see during preparations for the Olympics. Nack finds a place for the fascinating offbeat story as well as the sensational. Alongside Eli Saslow s captivating article about an obscure seventeenth-century sport, similar to a giant rugby scrum, carried out in the streets of Kirkwall, Scotland, stands Franz Lidz s scoop of the year, a controversial and rare look into the life of George Steinbrenner, baseball s largest but recently most enigmatic figure. This year s collection marks another wonderful addition to one of the most consistently satisfying titles in the Best American series (Booklist).

Books about sports have ignored this dimension of the subject, particularly the athletes� own autobiographical accounts. &nbsp;In Sporting Lives, &nbsp;the first book to examine the two popular realms of sports and autobiography, James Pipkin looks at recurring patterns found in athletes� accounts of their lives and sporting experiences, examining language, metaphor, rhetorical strategies, and other elements to analyze sports from the inside out. Sporting Lives takes a fresh look at memoirs from baseball, football, basketball, golf, and other sports to explore how American athletes see themselves: not only how those images mesh with popular perceptions of them as heroes or celebrities but also how their accounts differ from those of sports journalists and other outsiders. Drawing on the life stories of such well-known figures as Wilt Chamberlain, Babe Ruth, and Martina Navratilova�both as-told-to and self-authored works�Pipkin follows players from the �echoing green� of eternal youth to the sometimes cultlike and isolated status of fame, interpreting recurring patterns both in the living of their lives and in the telling of them. He even considers Dennis Rodman�s four autobiographies to show how the contradictions of his self-portrayals reflect the Janus-faced quality of sports in the era of celebrity culture. As Pipkin shows, the life of the athlete involves more than mere athleticism; it is also a world of nostalgia and sentiment, missed opportunities and lost youth. He sheds light on athletes� common obsession with youth and body image�including gender and racial considerations�and explores their descriptions of being �in a zone,� that transcendent state when everything seems to click. And he considers the time that all athletes dread, when their bodies begin to betray them . . . and the cheering stops. While the lives of athletes may often suggest the magic of Peter Pan, Pipkin�s engaging study reveals that they are in many ways more like the Lost Boys. Sporting Lives shows that the meaning of sports is intertwined with the telling. It is both an eminently readable book for fans and a critically sophisticated analysis that will engage scholars of literature, sports or media studies, and American popular culture.', 184, '2008-01-01 00:00:00', 'Regional Sports, Sport Figures - General & Miscellaneous - Biography, Athletics - General & Miscellaneous, American Literature Anthologies', 'This first book to examine the two popular realms of sports and autobiography looks at recurring patterns found in athletes\' accounts of their lives and sporting experiences, examining language, metaphor, and other rhetorical strategies to analyze sports from the inside out.

The poets selected here--everyone from Hesiod to Yeats, Li Po to Dickinson--are first-rate, but for that very reason their work is multi-dimensional, thus hardly about, let alone ``for,\'\' men. The editors have organized the book into subjects such as ``Mother and Great Mother,\'\' war, father, ``Wildness\'\' and love. Their introductions to each section too often leap from the reality of men\'s feelings to abstractions, Jungian archetypes and myths. As advice for reading poems, their observation that ``for men depression is sometimes the entrance to the soul\'\' hardly seems helpful, and as psychology it comes close to the old masculine cliche that pain is good and one should suffer one\'s feelings stoically. But even if the anthology is all too manly, it contains many great poems which speak to us all regardless of sex. And, like the men\'s movement itself, the book bespeaks a genuine interest in overhauling conventional notions about what is masculine. Bly ( Iron John ) is a poet; Hillman ( Re-Visioning Psychology ) is a psychologist; Meade is a scholar of myth. $50,000 ad/promo.

She supports it not only with fat slices of Kerouac\'s best writing but also with an investigation into his bop prosody that gives his jazz-riff style a new currency. In fact, this volume may deal a fist in the face of the English sentence, because Kerouac\'s revamping of the sentence is so song-filled and emotion-ridden that its properties could well do for American prose what Whitman did for verse: give it new life. An alcoholic jamming by candlelight with scotch and pot on the kitchen table, he mixes jazz with Rimbaud\'s derangement of the senses to create a vehicle for his own anguish as he recollects his life on the run.

In a buoyant introduction, Santiago describes his own, youthful discovery of Puerto Rican writers-``the first book I read by a Puerto Rican author was the one the Jesuits at Xavier had denounced as pornographic and prejudiced against whites. I knew it had to be good\'\'-and explains why their writing continues to feel ``subversive.\'\' Jesus Colon fluidly combines a thumbnail history of the island\'s oppression with an explanation of why it takes a lot of effort before a Puerto Rican will ``ask you to have a cup of black coffee with him in his own kitchen.\'\' In ``Palante!

In general, the variety is impressive: Ana Lydia Vega, Martin Espada, Geraldo Rivera, a transcript of a Freddie Prinze monologue and a serious essay by the comedian\'s mother.

Powerful and compelling, Black on White provides a much-needed perspective that is sure to have a major impact on the study of race and race relations in America.Library JournalThese two bookEntities belong to a growing body of work that examines white identity through African American writings. Historian Roediger (Towards the Abolition of Whiteness, Norton, 1994) here collects illuminating views of \"whiteness\" from black writers ranging from such early figures as the revolutionary David Walker to contemporaries like Toni Morrison. Some of the expected sources are here, including James Baldwin\'s Going To Meet the Man and Richard Wright\'s Black Boy, but among several delightful surprises are George S. Schuyler\'s essay \"Our White Folks\" and Alice Walker\'s \"The Dummy in the Window: Joel Chandler Harris and the Invention of Uncle Remus.\" Although the anthology includes a range of perspectives, Roediger has essentially excluded \"the more reflexively antiwhite tradition represented (at times) by the nation of Islam, or by Leonard Jeffries\'s recent writing on whites.\" This results in some notable omissions, including Malcom X. Still, this is a valubable collection that should go a long way in helping us to understand America\'s troubled racial relations. Recommended for all collections. Sartwell (philosophy, Pennsylvania State Univ.) analyzes the perception of whiteness in the slave narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, the writings of W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, and Malcolm X, and contemporary rap music. He contends that whites, in seeking to establish their identity as the norm, ultimately render themselves invisible. Furthermore, white identity is typically constructed in comparison with nonwhite identities, often portraying the latter as inferior, he notes. Through the writings of African Americans, Sartwell believes whiteness can be viewed in a more objective manner. At the same time that he seeks to elucidate the texts, he grapples with his own whiteness. In the process, he has presented an engaging though disturbing investigation of the complex politics of identity. Recommended for academic libraries.Louis J.

Seventh grade wasn\'t too fun for anyone, but it seems to be a particular watershed event for these wordy gays and lesbians, who have risen to the assignment and reconjured that particular year with pubescent horror: the longing, the armpit hair, the confusion, the shame, the teasing -- it\'s all here. Thankfully, as the sage Judy Blume always assured us, it\'s only seventh grade, and most everyone survives it. Even gay kids. Seen from these 25 collected pieces -- many of them quite clever memoirs; some of them merely more overwrought gunk from the para-memoirist craze -- seventh grade is quite a hurdle, but also a magic place.\"', 'Queer 13: Lesbian and Gay Writers Recall Seventh Grade', 'queer-13'),

Beatty, who \"was the butt of the first joke [he\'d] ever heard,\" mines two centuries of African-American culture for speeches, poems, fiction, comics and screenplays that mirror his own glass-cutting wit and satisfy, in places, his taste for \"unintentional comedy.\" (To wit, \"The Wit and Wisdom of Mike Tyson.\") Apart from usual suspects like Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, a Norton anthology this is not. Selections from Fran Ross and Prophet Omega dizzy readers in their logical funhouses. Hattie Gossett\'s \"80s Version of the Dozens\" leads them through sewer pipes of lyrical imagination. The volume\'s general tenor is wild, winking and explosive. As such, it picks up where Chappelle\'s Show left off-gouging the government, lampooning cultures black and white, leaving no sacred cow unslaughtered. Even the smiling watermelon on the book\'s front cover has been retained despite sniffs by national media outlets. \"This is black humor,\" Beatty writes, \"and I don\'t mean African-American black.\" Indeed, at times-as when John Farris\'s schoolchildren blithely gun down pedestrians-you may need night-vision goggles to find the joke.

Editor Jon Meacham has chosen pieces by journalists, novelists, historians, and artists, bringing together a wide range of black and white perspectives and experiences.

Unfortunately, this collection also includes material such as four rather benign letters by Zelda Fitzgerald (published here for the first time) in which she describes \"picnic suppers\' and \"idyllic days\" spent at Highland Hospital.

The narratives, chosen and edited by historian Conway, a former president of Smith College, are grouped into the areas of freedom-fighting, science, arts and letters, and social reform. Among the women relaying their encounters with discrimination are Marian Anderson, preeminent black contralto, who was celebrated in Europe but barred from appearing at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and Margaret Mead, the renowned anthropologist, who refused a ``safe\'\' field assignment and forged her own way in Samoa. Many, like writer Zora Neale Hurston, emerged from broken or impoverished families to pursue an education and find a way to support themselves and their families. The strong, clear voices of the trailblazers found in this exemplary anthology reveal a sheer delight in excellence, adventure, and intellectual challenge.

The book was inspired, he notes in his preface, by his discovery that there was no wide-ranging compilation on the subject. O\'Nan\'s selections, primarily excerpts from full-length works, include fiction by Tim O\'Brien (Going After Cacciato, The Things They Carried), James Webb (Fields of Fire), Larry Heinemann (Paco\'s Story), Stephen Wright (Meditations in Green), and John Del Vecchio (The 13th Valley), plus excerpts from memoirs by Robert Mason (Chickenhawk), Ronald J. Glasser (365 Days), and Michael Lee Lanning (The Only War We Had). O\'Nan also includes the lyrics of a variety of period songs (\'The Ballad of the Green Berets,\' \'Born in the USA\'), critical summaries of films about the war, and some poetry. His adroit notes point out some of the most salient features of this literature (the relative neglect of the Vietnamese experience of war; the evolution of the American soldier protagonist from hero to cynical survivor; the persistent attempt to puzzle out what the war tells us about our society and government), and a glossary, bibliography, and chronology further help set the work in context.

Major names are well represented, and new voices are also included, which many teachers and students may not have heard of yet, but will appreciate. There is a good balance of men and women, and I was especially impressed with the inclusion of many poets producing work before 1900. What makes special this collection special is the general introduction, along with the biographies that introduce the work of each poet. The introduction articulates clearly the history of African American poetry, and emphasizes the political and historical context of the poems. The editors then use the work of Sterling A. Brown as a model for investigating and understanding the work of each individual poet. Each biography provides basic facts and summary of the work, and also some evaluation of style, topic and form, which will help both students and teachers study and appreciate the poetry. There is no index, but there is an accessible, chronologically arranged table of contents at the beginning and a Selected Bibliographies section at the end. This is a valuable and inexpensive addition to all libraries, which will likely pique the interest of YA poets and non-poets alike.

Shields exposes a significant cultural blindness within American consciousness. Noting that the biblical myth of Adam has long dominated ideas of what it means to be American, Shields argues that an equally important component of our nation\'s cultural identity--a secular one deriving from the classical tradition-has been seriously neglected. The author finds various Early American texts, including pastorals, pastoral elegies, literary independence poems, tracts on educational theories, religious discourses, and political writings, laden with elements of classicism, particularly the myth of Aeneas as depicted by Vergil. Shields demonstrates that Aeneas, Vergil\'s hero of the Aeneid, was an especially apt figure for New World discourse in that he epitomized \"the sailor who struck out onto dangerous, uncharted seas in order to discover a new land in which to build a new civilization. \"Shields shows how both the myth of Adam and the myth of Aeneas, in crossing over to America from Europe, dynamically intermingled in the thought of the earliest American writers. This rearticulation of the myths of Adam and Aeneas became peculiarly adapted to the demands of the American adventure in freedom. Shields argues that uncovering and acknowledging the classical roots of our culture can allay the American fear of \"pastlessness\" that the long-standing emphasis on the Adamic myth has generated. The author\'s probing analysis sheds new light on the works of such seminal figures as Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Phillis Wheatley, George Washington, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville. But it does much more than that--it posits a new model for American studies. \"This model,\" Shields writes, \"is not composed of a single strand which can only direct the struggle to explore the dimensions of American culture in a linear fashion--an inevitable dead end. The image of two strands coming together, intertwining and interconnecting so as to accommodate virtually infinite possibilities, more accurately captures the dynamic of Americanness.\"', 'The American Aeneas: Classical Origins of the American Self', 'the-american-aeneas'),

Autobiographies and personal narratives told of slavery\'s horrors, newspapers railed against racism in its various forms, and poetry, novellas, reprinted sermons and speeches told tales of racial uplift and redemption.The editors examine the important and previously overlooked pamphleteering tradition and offer new insights into how and why the printed word became so important to black activists during this critical period.

She teaches American Studies at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington.Kirkus ReviewsAmerican women, editor Sandoz observes, have long had a \"fierce love of sport\"&#58; In 1866, Vassar College already fielded two women\'s baseball teams. That love, based on the evidence of these mostly contemporary stories, poems, and novel excerpts, has produced some energetic, thoughtful explorations of the liberating possibilities of sport for women. Many of the pieces here deal with the struggles of women&#151;especially adolescents&#151;trying to accept that competition is good, that winning is even better, and that it\'s possible to be both a woman and an athlete without slighting either. Stephanie Grant\'s story \"Posting-Up\" offers a tough- minded description of the manner in which her adolescent narrator discovers the exhilaration of playing basketball well and aggressively. \"Scotti Scores,\" by Jane Gilliland, carries the idea a step further, exploring how the members of a high-school hockey team astonish themselves and their coach by cooperating to outplay a far more experienced team. Stories by Laurie Colwin, Ellen Gilchrist, Sara Maitland, and Jennifer Levin are particularly strong, as are the excerpts from novels by Carol Anshaw and Sara Vogan. Some tales suffer from seeming too programmatic, too thin and message-laden. But, overall, a useful introduction to an overlooked area in contemporary fiction and poetry.', 'A Whole Other Ball Game: Women\'s Literature on Women\'s Sport', 'a-whole-other-ball-game'),

Concentration: the focus on a body of writing with a heritage, an era, or a style in common that tests shared visions and constraints. Magnification: an expanse that seems to widen and deepen as we are allowed to take a look at it, and then another look.

But what is \"American poetry?\" Is there truly such a thing as an American poetic tradition, spanning over nearly four centuries from colonial times to the turn of the millennium? In The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry, Jay Parini, a respected American poet and critic in his own right, offers an authoritative survey of the elusive category that is the poetry of the American people. The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry covers all of the canonical American poets, from the colonial to the contemporary-Anne Bradstreet, Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, and Adrienne Rich are all included. But Parini has also selected a broad sampling of poetry from voices that have been heard as widely over the years. Here, for the first time, is a thorough collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry by women, Native American, and African Americans. Within these pages readers will find the many different traditions that make up the expansive collage of American poetry. Here are the Transcendentalists-Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and Henry David Thoreau; and the Imagists-William Carlos Williams, Amy Lowell, H.D., and Carl Sandburg. Readers will discover also the early twentieth-century movement of African-American poetic expression, known as the Harlem Renaissance-James Weldon Johnson, Countee Cullen, Gwendolyn Bennett, and Langston Hughes are all solidly represented in The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry. Jay Parini\'s introduction deftly guides us into the rich tradition of poetry in our country. Whether in search of a well-known classic or a poem that is not yet considered part of the American poetic tradition, readers will find much to enjoy in The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry. Columbia University Press American poetry from pre-Revolutionary times to the present excluding the work of poets born after WWII is sampled in The Columbia Anthology of American Poetry, edited by poet and teacher Jay Parini. Leading poets from three centuries are well-represented, with the works of less well-recognized writers, e.g., Frances Sargent Osgood and Alice Carey in the 19th century, Claude McKay and Jean Toomer in the 20th, sprinkled throughout.

It\'s about a young woman who believes that there\'s a sixteenth-century Spanish conquistador in her living room. Harvest is a touching drama about a farmer who refuses to give up his farm, even ashe is going under. He manages to hold onto his farm but not his wife, who didn\'t bargain for a life of poverty and struggle. Neighborhood 3: Requisition of Doom is a drama about a group of teenagers in a suburban neighborhood obsessed with an online video game set in their community, who come to believe that they are being invaded by aliens from outer space-who look suspiciously like their parents.

Unconditional was produced by LAByrinth Theater Company at The Public Theater. Of its three disparate stories, the central one is about a human resources worker who becomes enraged when he is laid off after many years on the job and just a short while from retirement and the pension he was counting on.All these plays represent the best of American playwriting.

Unfortunately, this first large-scale international attempt to explore the relationship between the two forms disappoints. Some 132 poets are arranged alphabetically. Among them are Sterling A. Brown, Robert Creeley, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Langston Hughes, Carl Sandburg, and Leopold Senghor. The selection, however, is both too inclusive and too diverse. Dana Goia describes Bix Beiderbecke, but his stilted lines conflict with the music\'s rhythms; Heather McHugh\'s formal approach feels equally superficial. Individual poems seldom interact to form a larger statement; the ``music appendix,\'\' historically situating these selections, might have been a better organizational device. The statement of poetics, gathered from less than half the poets, are this volume\'s most valuable asset.-- Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, ``Soho Weekly News,\'\' New York', 'The Jazz Poetry Anthology', 'the-jazz-poetry-anthology'),

Alas, the latest collection of plays from the Humana Festival met the floor several times. Except for Eric Coble\'s Natural Selection, Adam Bock\'s Three Guys and a Brenda, and Sharr White\'s Six Years(also included in New Playwrights), the works are disappointing. Natural Selection, set at a time when the world outdoors is viewed with fear and suspicion, is funny and off balance-a sort of sequel to Thornton Wilder\'s The Skin of Our Teeth. Three Guysbends gender like a damp willow branch (a theme also taken up with some subtlety by Jordan Harrison\'s Act a Lady). Six Yearstracks the integration, disintegration, and reintegration (maybe) of the marriage of Phil and Meredith. It\'s deeply disturbing, tragic, and moving and would make for a very satisfying night at the theater.Lepidus brings forth the ninth volume of Smith &amp; Kraus\'s \"Best Plays\" series, and it\'s mighty fine. The seven works are all full-length plays, and every one of them deserves production-from university theater to community theater to professional companies. The common theme among these works seems to be outsiders seeking love. Michael Golamco\'s Cowboy Versus Samurai, about three (and the only) Asians in a Wyoming town, speaks at operatic intensity to the \"only\" out there, wherever they are. And then there\'s John Cariani\'s Almost, Maine, a wonderful play made up of four actors, 19 roles, 11 interconnectedscenes, a rural setting, love in the air, and shooting stars. If your library has the run of the series to which these volumes belong, there\'s no reason not to get the latest issue. New Playwrightsis strongly recommended for academic and public libraries; Humana Festival 2006would be better appreciated by theater departments in an academic setting.', 'New Playwrights: The Best Plays of 2006', 'new-playwrights'),

According to Wicker\'s outspoken foreword, \"prisons and the violence and despair they symbolize... are a blot on American life and history.\" The U.S. penal system contains a population greater than that of New Hampshire, and even the pretense of rehabilitation was long ago subsumed by the need to punish. Beginning with accounts of the victims of Jim Crow and Black Code laws in the segregationist South and going through the contemporary journalism of Dannie Martin and Mumia Abu-Jamal, these views from behind the bars should be required reading for anyone concerned about the violence in our society and the high rate of recidivism. Franklin, in his introduction, argues that the institution of slavery has its modern counterpart in penal servitude While he sometimes seems stuck in the clichs of a New Left rhetoric, he has done a fine job of rediscovering the prison writers of the 1920s (a period of real flowering among convict writers, supported by H.L. Mencken\'s American Mercury magazine) like Jim Tully, Chester Himes and Ernie Booth. In this context, the more famous works of writers such as Nelson Algren, Malcolm X and Jack Henry Abbot, gain a fuller resonance. The book also highlights writers, like Piri Thomas, who are alive today but neglected.

To the hellish chaos of a maximum-security prison he brought his own limitless propensity for violence - he often spent months at a time in solitary confinement, \"the Hole.\" \"After years in the cold embrace of the state prison system, Hartman discovered a vocation for writing; he also met, through a chance phone call, the woman he would marry and have a child by.

Countee Cullen, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston are among the authors represented, and the selected works include essays, poetry, prose, and drama, with lyrics and visual art used as illustration. The editors also break with the tendency to define the beginning and end of the renaissance with political events by focusing on specific literary works, which allows them to broaden the period to 1916-37. Both editors have done previous research in the field of African American women\'s literature and include a biographical sketch of each writer to underline how their gender, class, and sexual orientation shaped their work.

The editors have been refreshingly inclusive and imaginative in their selection: some of the writers are internationally known, others are anthologized here for the first time. The richness of material, ranging from Native American origin myths to Hollywood novels dissecting the American Dream; from the familiar voices of John Steinbeck, Jack London, and William Saroyan to the less-well-known narratives of Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton, Josephine Miles, and Jade Snow Wong--all of it captures the spirit and scope of the state itself. This first volume of the comprehensive two-volume anthology is divided into four parts. The first includes stories, legends, and songs of the indigenous tribes. The second section comprises letters, diaries, reports, and travel narratives that trace a century of exploration, discovery, and conquest. Part III includes Mother Lode tales by Mark Twain and Bret Harte, the first signs of California poetry, the rise of narrative by California women, the nature writing of John Muir and Mary Austin, and some of the earliest prose from writers of Asian background, as well as the maturing fiction of Jack London and Frank Norris. Part IV traces the period between the World Wars, when California literature came fully into its own. A lively introduction contextualizes each section, and concise biographical material is included for each writer. Volume Two, to be published in 2007, concentrates on the second half of the twentieth-century, during which California became one of the most active literary regions in the world.

Electricity later turned the city at night into an even more stunning spectacle of brilliantly lit streets and glittering skyscrapers. The advent of artificial lighting revolutionized the urban night, creating not only new forms of life and leisure, but also new ways of perceiving the nocturnal experience. New York Nocturne is the first book to examine how the art of the gaslit and electrified city evolved, and how representations of nighttime New York expanded the boundaries of modern painting, literature, and photography. Exploring the myriad images of Manhattan after dark, New York Nocturne shows how writers and artists took on the city\'s nocturnal blaze and transformed the scintillating landscape into an icon of modernity. The book traces key metaphors of the nighttime city: a seductive Babylon in the mid-1850s, a misty fairyland colonized by an empire of light in the early twentieth century, and a skyscraper-studded land of desire that became a stage for the voyeurism and violence of the 1940s and 1950s. The epilogue suggests how these themes have continued to shape our vision of nighttime New York ever since. Abundantly illustrated, New York Nocturne includes original readings of works by Whitman, Poe, Whistler, Riis, Stieglitz, Abbott, O\'Keeffe, Stella, Hopper, Weegee, Ellison, Jacquette, and many others.

William Chapman Sharpe begins New York Nocturne at a time when nighttime darkness was the norm and light -- first in the form of gas, then of electricity -- was radically disorienting, eventually transforming patterns of commerce and leisure. In this gorgeous, erudite book, the Barnard College professor examines the myriad ways that writers, painters, and photographers have represented New York nightlife, beginning in the mid-19th century, when works by Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, and Edgar Allan Poe dramatized the moral perils of the artificially lit city. Sharpe\'s journey takes him to the middle of the 20th century, by which time artists like Edward Hopper and Weegee exploit the nighttime\'s theatrical, voyeuristic potential. In between he covers James McNeill Whistler, Stephen Crane, John Sloan, Alfred Stieglitz, Georgia O\'Keeffe, Joseph Stella, and many others, with close readings of the literature and black-and-white and color reproductions of the art. Sharpe, whose own affection for the city is charmingly apparent here, insists throughout that artists and writers haven\'t simply reacted to the changes in urban existence; rather, they have \"helped turn the unscouted terrain of the urban night into a legible part of contemporary life.\" --Barbara Spindel', 'New York Nocturne: The City After Dark in Literature, Painting, and Photography, 1850-1950', 'new-york-nocturne'),

It was a period when the African-American came of age, with the clearest expression of this transformation visible in the remarkable outpouring of literature, art, and music. In these years the \"New Negro\" was born, as seen in the shift of black leadership from Booker T. Washington to that of W.E.B. Du Bois, from Tuskegee to New York, and for some, even to the African nationalism of Marcus Garvey. In Voices from the Harlem Renaissance, Nathan Irvin Huggins provides more than 120 selections from the political writings and arts of the period, each depicting the meaning of blackness and the nature of African-American art and its relation to social statement. Through these pieces, Huggins establishes the context in which the art of Harlem Renaissance occurred. We read the call to action by pre-Renaissance black spokesmen, such as A. Philip Randolph and W.E.B. DuBois who--through magazines such as The Messenger (\"the only radical Negro magazine\"), and the NAACP\'s Crisis--called for a radical transformation of the American economic and social order so as to make a fair world for black men and women. We hear the more flamboyant rhetoric of Marcus Garvey, who rejected the idea of social equality for a completely separate African social order. And we meet Alain Locke, whose work served to redefine the \"New Negro\" in cultural terms, and stands as the cornerstone of the Harlem Renaissance. Huggins goes on to offer autobiographical writings, poetry, and stories of such men and women as Langston Hughes, Nancy Cunard, Helen Johnson, and Claude McKay--writings that depict the impact of Harlem and New York City on those who lived there, as well as the youthfulness and exuberance of the period. The complex question of identity, a very important part of the thought and expression of the Harlem Renaissance, is addressed in work\'s such as Jean Toomer\'s Bona and Paul and Zora Neale Hurston\'s Sweat. And Huggins goes on to attend to the voices of alienation, anger, and rage that appeared in a great deal of the writing to come out of the Harlem Renaissance by poets such as George S. Schuyler and Gwendolyn Bennett. Also included are over twenty illustrations by such artists as Aaron Douglas whose designs illuminated many of the works we associate with the Harlem Renaissance: the magazines Fire and Harlem; Alain Locke\'s The New Negro; and James Weldon Johnson\'s God\'s Trombones. The vitality of the Harlem Renaissance served as a generative force for all New York--and the nation. Offering all those interested in the evolution of African-American consciousness and art a link to this glorious time, Voices from the Harlem Renaissance illuminates the African-American struggle for self-realization. Nathan Irvin Huggins showcases more than 120 selections from the political writings and arts of the Harlem Renaissance.

It was a period when the African American came of age - when the \"New Negro\" was born - with the clearest expression of this transformation visible in its remarkable outpouring of literature, art, and music. In Voices from the Harlem Renaissance, Nathan Irvin Huggins provides more than 120 selections from the political writings, literature, and art of this watershed period. Bringing together the most trenchant works from such writers as Langston Hughes, Nancy Cunard, Alain Locke, and Zora Neale Hurston, this fascinating collection depicts the impact of Harlem and New York City on those who lived there. While focusing on the youthfulness and exuberance of the period, Huggins attends to the voices of alienation, anger, and rage - whether softly intoned or stridently voiced - so widely reflected in the writing of poets such as George S. Schuyler and Gwendolyn Bennett. Also included are over twenty paintings and sculptures of the Renaissance period by such artists as Aaron Douglas, Sargent Johnson, and Hale Woodruff. The vitality of the Harlem Renaissance served as a generative force for all New York - and the nation.

There is a touching piece by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who recalls her childhood attempts to wish away her mother\'s serious illness. Mary Cantwell describes the painful birth of her baby.

American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century reveals the vigor and diversity of a tradition embracing solitary visionaries and congenial storytellers, humorists and dissidents, songwriters and philosophers. These two volumes reassess America\'s poetic legacy with a comprehensive sweep that no previous anthology has attempted. This second volume follows the evolution of American poetry from the monumental mid-century achievements of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson to the modernist stirrings of Stephen Crane and Edwin Arlington Robinson. The cataclysm of the Civil War - reflected in fervent antislavery protests, in marching songs and poetic calls to arms, and in muted postbellum expressions of grief and reconciliation - ushered in a period of accelerating change and widening regional perspectives. Among the unfamiliar pleasures to be savored in this volume are the penetrating meditations of the reclusive Frederick Goddard Tuckerman, the eloquent lyricism of Emma Lazarus, the mournful, superbly crafted fin de siecle verse of Trumbull Stickney. Here too are the pioneering African-American poets (Frances Harper, Albery Allson Whitman, Paul Laurence Dunbar); popular humorists (James Whitcomb Riley, Eugene Field); writers embodying America\'s newfound cosmopolitanism (Edith Wharton, George Santayana); and extravagant self-mythologizing figures who could have existed nowhere else, like the actress Adah Isaacs Menken and the frontier poet Joaquin Miller. Parodies, dialect poems, song lyrics, and children\'s verse evoke the liveliness of an era when poetry was accessible to all. Here are poems that played a crucial role in American public life, whether to arouse the national conscience (Edwin Markham\'s \"The Man with the Hoe\") or to memorialize the golden age of the national pastime (Ernest Lawrence Thayer\'s \"Casey at the Bat\"). An entire section of tLibrary JournalIn size and ambition, this may be the largest selection of poetry from our nation\'s first full century since Edmund Stedman\'s An American Anthology, 1787-1900, published more than 90 years ago. With its special sections of Native American poems, African American spirituals and hymns, folksongs, and popular or patriotic verses (e.g., ``Battle Hymn of the Republic,\'\' ``Home, Sweet Home!\'\' and Stephen Foster\'s lyrics), the present volume evokes an era when poetry was enjoyed more than studied, written out of the desire for self-expression rather than the need for tenure. Major poets like Dickinson and Whitman are amply represented, but the collection also allows readers to rediscover the graceful strength of Sarah Orne Jewett, Ella Wilcox\'s nearly modernist irony, the Goreyesque eccentricity of Ambrose Bierce, and president John Quincy Adams\'s way with ballad meter. Arrangement is chronological by poet\'s date of birth; the accompanying biographical sketches, a chronology, notes, and an essay on textual selection were not available for review.

Chronicling Kerouac\'s adventures as he traveled across North America with his companions Neal Cassady, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and other members of the Beat Generation, On the Road takes a unique look at a lost postwar America. In Paradise Road, Jay Atkinson sets out to re-create Kerouac\'s journeys of the late 1940s, depicting the travels of the author and his longtime friends as they retrace the five major trips Jack Kerouac took with his pals. Writing with a novelist\'s eye and ear, Atkinson creates a compelling portrait of North America&#58; its roaring blues bars and nightclubs, empty country roads, and remote prairie towns and byways as well as the enduring warmth and humor of its citizens. Jay Atkinson grew up in Methuen, Massachusetts, a few miles from Jack Kerouac\'s hometown of Lowell. In this book, Atkinson compares his experiences with those of his former \"neighbor,\" detailing how the country has changed since Kerouac\'s time. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this book is the various ways in which the small towns of America have remained the same. Bringing to mind the writing of Kerouac, Walt Whitman, Henry David Thoreau, and Jack London, Atkinson\'s narrative is a celebration of ordinary American towns and the extraordinary people who reside there. Like Kerouac, Atkinson finds his journey interrupted, changed, and enriched by people he meets along the way?&#8212;a barmaid who struggles to quit drinking on the job, a wizened bus driver laboring to fix his car and drive his wife to her cancer treatment, and the former college basketball star who still lives with his ex-girlfriend because neither of them can afford to live alone.

The city was seen by residents and observers as the stage on which the possibilities of freedom would be tested and a post-slavery future would be played out for the nation. Philadelphia\'s charged setting produced a distinctive literary tradition that confronted issues of race, character, violence, and liberty. Verbal performance and social behavior assumed the weight of race and nation. The city\'s social experiments would have international consequences. This account of Philadelphia\'s literary history from 1790 to1860 brings together writers familiar (Charles Brockden Brown, Edgar Allan Poe, John Edgar Wideman), lesser known (Hugh Henry Brackenridge, George Lippard, Frank J. Webb), and obscure (Mathew Carey, Robert Montgomery Bird, William Whipper, Joseph Willson). It draws on a host of diverse, often discounted expressive forms, from fever accounts and metempsychic fiction to caricatures and book covers. Samuel Otter\'s authoritative study considers the significance of geographical, social, and literary \"place.\" It offers a model for thinking about the relationships between literature and history and among European-American and African-American writers. It challenges conventional narratives of American literary history.

Spanning over 100 years, from the slave era to the New Negro Movement, this extraordinary collection contradicts or nuances established notions that slavery fractured families, devalued sexual morality, distorted gender roles, and set in motion forces that now produce dismal and dangerous domestic situations. A culmination of twenty years of diligent research by noted scholar Frances Smith Foster, this anthology features selections on love and courtship, marriage, marriage rituals, and family. A compelling introduction places the primary texts in their social and literary context. A bibliography offers suggestions for further reading. This volume includes materials by well known writers such as Frances E. W. Harper, Charles Chesnutt, and Alice Dunbar Nelson, but the majority of works are previously unknown or difficult-to-access materials. Many provide startling contrasts to representations in canonical literature. For example, \"Patrick Brown\'s First Love\" is a radical alternative to Frederick Douglass\'s \"The Heroic Slave,\" and Thomas Detter\'s \"The Octoroon\" replaces the traditionally tragic mulatto trope with a female protagonist who shocks and awes. Love and Marriage in Early African America also changes our ideas about the relationship between religion and politics in early African America by featuring texts from the Afro-Protestant press; that is, the publishing organizations, writers, and reading groups under the direct auspices of, or publicly associated with, Afro-Protestant churches.', 360, '2007-01-01 00:00:00', 'Marriage, Peoples & Cultures - American Anthologies, Family - Literary Anthologies, Literature Anthologies - General & Miscellaneous', 'An eye-opening anthology of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century African American primary writings on love, courtship, and family', 'Love and Marriage in Early African America', 'love-and-marriage-in-early-african-america'),

Guest editor Komunyakaa (Neon Vernacular, 1994) argues that the avant-garde, which he terms the \"exploratory\" movement, exists as \"a poetry that borders on cultivated solecism and begs theorists to decipher it\" and that it is \"death in language\"; by contrast, the poetry he has chosen \"has content.\" Finally, the poems themselves appear; here are fresh gems from Richard Howard, W. S. Merwin, Galway Kinnell (a spectacular threnody on the fall of New York\'s World Trade Center towers), Carolyn Kizer, Rita Dove, Richard Wilbur, James Tate, Louise Gleck, Philip Levine, C.K. Williams, and the three most recent Pulitzer Prize winners, Stephen Dunn, Carl Dennis and Paul Muldoon. Two other poets stand out-Amy Gerstler contributes an amusing Gilda Radner-like piece about misreading a mailer that wants to send her \"Beethoven\'s Greatest Symphonies,\" while Ruth Stone (b. 1915) gives the proceedings a suitably youthful air with her speculative \"Lines\": \"Voice, perhaps you are the universe;/ the hum of spiders.\" Nowhere near as lively as last year\'s Robert Creeley-edited compilation, the 16th edition of this annual has pleasures of its own.

There are experimental and innovative works that stretch and re-imagine our expectations about theatre. There\'s a hilarious and profane comedy that looks danger squarely in the eye and spits at it; a wise and touching piece composed of five interlocking monologues that gradually reveal profound truths; and a moving and insightful drama that points hopefully and heroically toward a renewed faith in the principles on which our country was founded.Community News Publications of Delaware - Paula ShulakThere are two verse plays included which is unusual in and of itself, but the excellence of their poetry also is astounding. The Death of King Arthur by Matthew Freeman is a masterful rewriting of the familiar Camelot story which depicts in a totally new way the psyches of the characters we know so well. ...Equally well done is J. Scott Reynolds\' poetic version of another classic, this time a novel by Balzac. The Wild Ass s Skin is easy to read, thought provoking and contains some of the cleverest comic verse that I have read. A morality play of the highest order, we learn a lesson as we laugh. ...I thoroughly enjoyed The Resurrectionist by Kate Chell and Summerland by Brian Thorstenson. The former takes place in 17th Century England when it was commonplace for grave robbers to sell bodies to doctors for the study of the new science of anatomy. This fascinating topic is the background for the coming of age tale of a strong young woman whose plight unfolds before us. (Incidentally this script reads very well which is not always the case since plays are written to be performed.) Summerland is also about coming of age, but in the entirely different modern setting of rugged South Dakota. It presents a young man learning about his manhood with the firm guidance of his pioneer great grandmother in the background. ... Match by Marc Chun should really be seen to be fully appreciated but the ability of its author shines through even on paper. It is a brilliant juxtaposition of four subplots with an ingenious interweaving of lines from the four stories going on simultaneously. It is almost too difficult to describe but onstage it must be nothing short of miraculous I am sure. What an impact this show must have! Add to that the fact that the play deals beautifully with the questioning of life and death, especially after September 11, and you have a recipe for sure success. Finally, the play entitled Reality by Curtiss I Cook is my favorite. An all black cast adds to the impact of this fascinating look at the question of what is real? The internal twists and turns of the plot keep the audience (or the reader) on their toes as we delve back and forth between two or three kinds of reality and replay the same scenes two or three times until they are right . There is a strong message here which is worth waiting for and you are engrossed in the action from beginning to end. ', 'Plays and Playwrights 2002', 'plays-and-playwrights-2002'),

Selections span time (the earliest pieces are from Mourning Dove and Ella Cara Deloria from the 1920s and 1930s) and numerous tribal traditions throughout North America. Centering on women\'s experiences, the first section concerns images of birth and creation; subsequent chapters deal with marriage and family, and women\'s powers and mysteries. Among works from well-known women writers are the prologue from Paula Gunn Allen\'s The Woman Who Owned the Shadows, and poems by Joy Harjo (\"Deer Dancer\" and \"Wolf Warrior\"), Luci Tapahonso (\"Above the Canyon Floor\") and Ines Hernandez-Avila (\"Grandpa\'s Song for Little Bear\"). Louise Erdrich is represented (in a selection from her novel Tracks), and so are Beth Brant (\"Coyote Learns a New Trick\") and Leslie Silko (material from Storyteller). Such new and emerging voices as Shaunna McCovey, Cheryl Savageau and Deborah Miranda are each accorded two selections. The collection, however, seems unbalanced. Many of the pieces, particularly those from the more noted writers, have appeared elsewhere, and most of these writers are represented by one brief entry, while lesser figures are granted more space. There are also curious omissions: there is nothing by E. Pauline Johnson, whom Beth Brant has described as the mother of Native women\'s literature.

He shows that next to land, slaves were the most valuable property, and that even people such as Jefferson who feared the effect of slavery on society feared emancipation and free blacks even more.

The New Anthology of American Poetry is designed to become the standard text for college courses in American poetry, and it will also appeal to general readers who wish to explore the range and diversity of this literary form. The series demonstrates how a succession of canons of American poetry have evolved, with certain poets silenced until the present day, while others who emerged and then faded are now ready to be retrieved. Readers will find more attention devoted to women poets and to artists from African American, Asian American, Latino, and Native American cultures than in any previous anthology. Readers will also encounter an extremely solid presentation of long-established writers. The anthology offers not just a unique and teachable selection of poets and poems, but also concise introductions to periods and styles, brief bibliographies of key primary and secondary texts, and critical selections on the art of poetry by the anthologized poets themselves. VOLUME I: Traditions and Revolutions, Beginnings to 1900 Volume I begins with a generous selection of Native American materials, then spans the years from the establishment of the American colonies to about 1900, a world on the brink of World War I and the modern era. Part One focuses on poetry from the very beginnings through the end of the eighteenth century. The expansion and development of a newly forged nation engendered new kinds of poetry. Part Two includes works from the early nineteenth century through the time of the Civil War. The poems in Part Three reflect the many issues affecting a nation undergoing tumultuous change: the Civil War, immigration, urbanization, industrialization, and cultural diversification.

Gonzales is the author of I Am Joaquin, an epic poem of the Chicano Movement that lives on in film, sound recording, and hundreds of anthologies. Gonzales and other Chicanos established the Crusade for Justice, a Denver-based civil rights organization, school, and community center, in 1966. The school, La Escuela Tlatelolco, lives on today some three decades after its founding. In Message to Aztlan, Dr. Antonio Esquibel, Professor Emeritus of Metropolitan State College of Denver, has compiled the first collection of Gonzales\' diverse writings: the original I Am Joaquin (1967), along with a new Spanish translation; seven major speeches (1968-78); two plays, The Revolutionist and A Cross for Maclovio (1966-67); various poems written during the 1970s and a selection of letters. These varied works demonstrate the evolution of Gonzales\' thought on human and civil rights. Any examination of the Chicano Movement is incomplete without this volume. An eight-page photo insert accompanies the text.Library JournalThis edition features selected writings of the Chicano civil rights leader, handpicked by Gonzales himself with the help of his longtime friend and political associate Esquibel (emeritus, Metropolitan State Coll. of Denver). The years represented in these writings, 1966-1980, were important ones for the Chicano movement, as mainstream America had just begun to wake up to the concerns of Mexican Americans and other Latin American citizens. As his speeches reveal, Gonzales was a key figure. His words expose and attack the cultural stereotypes plaguing his people for centuries under Euro-American domination and emphasize education for the Chicano people, both academic and political. Also included in this work is the famous \"Yo Soy Joaquin,\" an epic poem covering the history of Aztec civilization and the fate of its descendants today. Gonzales\'s poetry and plays (also featured in this edition) may seem a bit dated and melodramatic today, but they are historically important and represent the struggles encountered by Chicanos up to the 1980s. Gonzales hoped that this work would \"inspire and motivate a new generation of Chicanos,\" and for this reason it belongs in academic libraries and public libraries with many Chicano or Mexican American patrons.

From this premise, Bryant is able to include writers like Ralph Ellison, James Agee and William Styron who migrated north but whose works nonetheless both inform and are informed by the regional experience of the South. In more or less chronological order, Bryant leads the reader from the early plantation fiction with its idealized notions of the Old South, through the various movements centered around Vanderbilt Universitythe Fugitives, the Agrarians and the New Criticismall of which contributed greatly to the mid-century \"Southern Renaissance,\" and beyond to a broad discussion of postmodern and contemporary writers. Special attention is given to major writers such as Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Shelby Foote and Robert Penn Warren, whom Bryant designates as \"the supreme summary figure of the century,\" but the book also incorporates and draws connections between lesser-known writers or those whose one-time significance has since faded. Well organized with subchapters devoted to African American writers, women writers, playwrights, poets and critics, the book includes a good deal of background and biographical information.

Since this anthology emphasizes reporting and analysis, there is no overlap with the older series The Best American Essays, which emphasizes the personal essay. In another refreshing choice, the book contains only one celebrity interview, a genre that dominates so many of our magazines. Some of the essays are horrifying&#58; Richard Preston\'s piece on smallpox, Vanity Fair reports on torture and genocide in Yugoslavia, and the longest essay in the book, Kenneth Cain\'s report on the civil war in Liberia. Others are touching, including Gary Smith\'s Sports Illustrated rumination on a photograph taken in the Texas Christian University locker room minutes before the 1957 Cotton Bowl. In all the reportorial pieces, precise detail and intelligent analysis are evident, none more so than in Bryan Hayes\'s fascinating piece from The Sciences on the elaborate astronomical clock of the Strasbourg Cathedral, an essay subtitled \"When one millennium\'s bright ideas become inscrutable legacies for the next.\" The winners also include three excellent short stories, all from The New Yorker, including a funny and moving story of sexual frustration, \"The Barber\'s Unhappiness\" by George Saunders, and Jhumpa Lahiri\'s charming story of Bengali immigrants to London, \"The Third and Final Continent.\" Another category represented here is movie and book reviews. Teenage readers might be especially interested in Tom Carson\'s critique of Saving Private Ryan, first published in Esquire.

The stories, recollections, letters and essays range widely in topic, tone, style and quality. Unfortunately, most of the strongest pieces are buried deep in the book. Among them, the story ``Personality Fabulosa\'\' by Monica Palacios captures with deceptive levity a heavy crush at the moment it develops into mutual courtship. Also terrific, Lucha Corpi\'s essay, ``Epiphany: The Third Gift\'\' depicts a tomboy distressing her traditional parents, who find solace in her bookishness: \"`When you educate a man,\' my father would often tell my younger sister and me, `you educate an individual. But when you educate a woman, you educate the whole family.\'\" Mary Helen Ponce\'s ``Just Dessert\'\' deftly portrays a disastrous dinner date, as the woman futilely tries to concentrate on the man\'s gorgeous lips and ignore the bigotry coming out of them. The stories of Cristina Garca, Aurora Levins Morales, Kathleen Ann Gonzlez and Judith Ortiz Cofer also work brilliantly. Less successfully, other writers rely too much on their ethnicity for interest rather than intrinsic merit. For example, Esmeralda Santiago\'s excerpt comes across as politically correct and facile: ``Americanos talk funny when they speak Spanish.\'\' By and large, however, the several gems in this collection outweigh the weak parts.

In this second installment, Straub ventures onto somewhat more adventurous ground. His selections bring readers completely up to date with the genre, featuring tales from even the newest writers, such as M. Rickert and Joe Hill. This thorough anthology is likely to replace Fraser and Wise\'s 1944 Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural as a lib. It foreshadows the careers of writers who may very well turn out to be classics. Straub\'s reach is admirably broad, bringing to light worthy but under the radar talents such as Jane Rice and Jack Snow, both pulp writers who flourished briefly at the beginning of the \"modern\" era. Yet, he leaves room for the more mainstream writers: Jerome Bixby, Donald Wandrei, Fritz Leiber, Richard Matheson, and Poppy Z. Brite alongside Shirley Jackson, Paul Bowles, Joy Carol Oates, and Truman Capote. Straub incorporates such writers with originality: choosing, for example, to use Tennessee Williams\' \"The Mysteries of the Joy Rio\" for once rather than his more common \"The Vengeance of Nitocris.\" The anthology has genuinely imaginative writing and editorial vision.

In later years, untold numbers and kinds of people have felt the draw of the river\'s torrents, which pour down theAppalachians along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Because of Deliverance the Chattooga looms enigmatically in our sharedimagination, as iconic as Twain\'s Mississippi--or maybe Conrad\'s Congo.This is John Lane\'s search for the real Chattooga--for the truths that reside somewhere in the river\'s rapids, along its shores, or in its travelers\' hearts. Lane balances the dark, indifferent mythical river of Deliverance against the Chattooga known to locals and to the outdoors enthusiasts who first mastered its treacherous vortices and hydraulics.

At the end of his run, Lane leaves us still fully possessed by the Chattooga\'s mystery, yet better informed about its place in his world and ours.John Lane\'s writing has been published in American Whitewater, Southern Review, Terra Nova, and Fourth Genre. His bookEntities include Waist Deep in Black Water (Georgia), several volumes of poetry, and Weed Time, a gathering of his essays. Lane is an associate professor of English at Wofford College in Spartanburg, South Carolina.Publishers WeeklyThis extended personal narrative by poet and author Lane (Waist Deep in Black Water) focuses on the Chattooga River, which runs along the border of Georgia and South Carolina. The river and the \"isolated, rugged mountain landscape\" through which it runs were the setting for James Dickey\'s 1970 novel Deliverance and its 1972 film adaptation, about a group of suburban men whose canoeing trip becomes a face-off with torture and death. Lane thinks that Dickey\'s tale was \"one of the central adventure stories of my generation,\" which told of a \"hero\'s journey of separation, initiation and return.\" Having previously explored the river, Lane returns to journey the entire length of it, describing its natural beauty and danger as well as pausing to view it through the prism of Dickey\'s book. In the best parts, Lane artfully applies his poetic sensibility to the river itself, such as when he describes the results of a heavy rainfall: \"the highway swings around swells of native rock, the runoff peels into the Chattooga drainage, burbling through culverts and ping-ponging off stream pebbles weathered from the old Appalachian range.\" Equally enjoyable, though less moving, are Lane\'s portraits of local residents and their views about the book and film, which did not paint a flattering picture of the area and its citizens. The weakest parts are those where Lane directly compares the river with aspects of Dickey\'s book. Lane\'s own writing and observations are good enough to stand outside of Dickey\'s considerable shadow. (Apr.)

Abu-Jamal writes on many different topics, including the ironies that abound within the U.S. prison system and the consequences of those ironies, and his own case. Mumia\'s composure, humor, and connection to the living world around him represents an irrefutable victory over the \"corrections\" system that has for two decades sought to isolate and silence him.

Also included is a one-hour CD of Mumia Abu-Jamal reading his on-air pieces written for All Things Considered and commentary from Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Adrienne Rich, Howard Zinn, and many others.Publishers WeeklyTo some, Abu-Jamal, convicted in the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer, is a cold-blooded cop killer, but to his supporters, the death-row inmate is a hero, wrongly condemned by a racist system. In this collection of forceful prison essays and radio talks written over the last decade (a sequel to Live from Death Row and Death Blossoms), former Black Panther Abu-Jamal maintains that he was targeted by the state because of his political beliefs and associations. He cites a recent Amnesty International report that calls for a new trial on the grounds that his 1982 trial was riddled with procedural errors and quite possibly contaminated by racism. Hanrahan, director of Prison Radio (which aired several of these commentaries after Abu-Jamal was pulled off the air by NPR\'s All Things Considered), describes Abu-Jamal\'s life in solitary confinement as a living hell and accuses prison authorities of constant harassment and censorship. Whatever one thinks of Abu-Jamal\'s guilt or innocence, his attack on capital punishment as a discriminatory, racist practice is compelling, as is his critique of our bloated prison system, which, according to an American Bar Association report cited here, is self-defeating because dehumanizing conditions produce more criminals. An outspoken political analyst, Abu-Jamal condemns Clinton\'s adoption of NAFTA, calls the war on drugs largely a \"War on Blacks\" and offers incisive commentary on rap music, the decline of African-American community life, police brutality and recent developments in Mexico, Peru, Iran and South Africa.

During their heyday, from the 1930s through the early 1960s, they were the face of literary culture in the city. They remain a source of interest, pride, and sometimes controversy. Austin is a well-known haven of liberal political activism, represented by such well-known figures as Lyndon B. Johnson, Ralph Yarborough, Ann and David Richards, Liz Carpenter, Willie Morris, John Henry Faulk, and Molly Ivins. The city is also a haven for literary writers, many of whom appear in these pages: Carolyn Osborn, Rolando Hinojosa-Smith, Dagoberto Gilb, Stephen Harrigan, and Lawrence Wright, to name a few. Among the poets, Thomas Whitbread, Dave Oliphant, David Wevill, and Christopher Middleton have long been on the scene. Certain sites recur-the University Tower, Barton Springs, various watering holes of another kind-so that anybody who has ever spent time in Austin will experience twinges of nostalgia for vanished icons, closed-down venues, and long-gone sites of pleasure brought to life once again, in these pages.Tom Dodge, - The Dallas Morning NewsMr. Graham has developed, via nonfiction, fiction, and poetry, a clear picture of Austin, its history and its present realities and postures.', 'Literary Austin', 'literary-austin'),

Over the centuries since, the people of New England have produced one of the great literary traditions of the world�an outpouring of poetry, fiction, history, memoirs, letters, and essays that records how the original dream of a godly commonwealth has been both sustained and transformed into a modern secular culture enriched by people of many backgrounds and convictions. Writing New England, edited by the literary scholar and critic Andrew Delbanco, is the most comprehensive anthology of this tradition, offering a full range of thought and style. The major figures of New England literature�from John Winthrop and Anne Bradstreet to Emerson, Hawthorne, Dickinson, and Thoreau, to Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, and John Updike�are of course represented, often with fresh and less familiar selections from their works. But Writing New England also samples a wide range of writings including Puritan sermons, court records from the Salem witch trials, Felix Frankfurter\'s account of the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, William Apess\'s eulogy for the Native American King Philip, pamphlets and poems of the Revolution and the Civil War, natural history, autobiographical writings of W.

Yet one purpose of this book is to convey some sense of New England\'s continuities and coherence...Not all the writers in this book are major figures (a few are barely known), but all are here because of the bracing freshness with which they describe places, people, ideas, and events to which, even if the subject is familiar, we are re-awakened.\"', 512, '2001-01-01 00:00:00', 'Regional American Anthologies', 'The story of New England writing begins some 400 years ago, when a group of English Puritans crossed the Atlantic believing that God had appointed them to bring light and truth to the New World.

Perhaps it\'s because New England was the original region. Emily Dickinson, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry James are not generally considered New Englanders so much as Americans. Delbanco, a renowned scholar of the Puritan experience in America (author of The Puritan Ordeal), wants to call attention to the fact that these writers were not simply from New England but of it. In this beautifully conceived collection, Delbanco has interspersed with unchallenged figures such as Thoreau and Hawthorne a few pieces that have been all but lost to the general reading public. William Apess, for example, is represented by an excerpt from his 1836 Eulogy on King Philip, chastising white for dispossessing Native Americans. Apess was a New Englander of Indian descent who became a Methodist preacher and eventually joined the Mashpee Indians on Cape Cod, leading a rebellion against their white overseers: \"And while you ask yourselves, \'What do they, the Indians, want?\' you have only to look at the unjust laws made for them and say, \'They want what I want.\' \" In his introduction, Delbanco sounds the \"keynote\" of the original New England identity as \"the throbbing heart of Christianity in the New World.\" As the new Eden did not fulfill itself, he concludes, New Englanders began an \"inward turn toward self-admonition [which] is the hallmark of what Henry James called \'the New England conscience.\' \" This is an excellent gathering of letters, poems, stories, essays and excerpts from novels and histories.

Many essays have aged well, but others have not; a reimagining of A Christmas Carol (Scrooge returns to his miserly self, an ending more in tune with the Contract with America) is loaded to capacity with mid-\'90s topical references, and the very subjects of some chapters have faded into obscurity. The analysis of Steve Forbes\'s political career, for example, is amusing, but may leave readers struggling to recall the candidacy it describes. Every page offers at least one clever turn of phrase and at least one scornful appraisal of people, like the \"self-appointed guardians of the nation\'s conscience\" from academia who \"wish to be consulted on matters that almost none of them understand.\" But those who recognize satire primarily in its farcical vein may wonder at some chapters. Is it really satire to point out that media coverage of the deaths of Princess Diana and John F. Kennedy Jr. was ridiculously overblown, or that Rudy Giuliani\'s attack on the Brooklyn Museum of Art was glaring political opportunism? It is: satire requires only that vice and absurdity be held up to contempt and ridicule, both of which Lapham supplies in erudite abundance. In one essay, he mentions Voltaire, Mark Twain and Ambrose Bierce. The entire book displays the skill with which he follows in their footsteps, and in another 20 years, one might expect its better chapters to be held in similar regard. (Nov.)

Though big names like Steve Martin and Bruce McCall are trumpeted on the cover, the real treats can be found in the work of less famous contributors. Francis Heaney\'s \"Holy Tango of Poetry,\" which imagines the results of poets writing poems whose titles are anagrams of their names-e.g. \"I\'m Leery Jocks\" by Joyce Kilmer, or \"Toilets\" by T.S.

Tim Carvell\'s account of his solo attempt at being a Neilsen family (he manufactured a couple of kids and wife named Gladys and made them all Eskimos) should be required reading for anyone who has ever longed to lie on annoying questionnaires. And Jeremy Simon\'s parody of an existential Zagat\'s guide is a witty send-up of a city staple (the entry for the opposable thumb reads: \"While this \'innovative\' evolution-a \'pick-up joint\' for the klutzy-is valued by locals for \'synergy\' with its surroundings, dissenters dis it as \'overrated\' \'finger food\'\"). Silly lists, \"unnatural histories,\" fake correspondences and countless other oddball selections round out this amusing volume. (Nov.)

He lives in Plainfield, Indiana.Publishers WeeklyIt\'s high time the traditional Publishers of Truth as Quakers originally called themselves published something for today\'s general readers outside the Quaker fold. Bill\'s anthology picks up where the Quaker Reader (edited by novelist Jessamyn West) left, focusing on writings from the latter half of the 20th century. The prose mix is lively: nonfiction devotional slices from modern mystic Thomas Kelly are served up along with such fiction as an excerpt from the murder mystery Quaker Testimony by Irene Allen, pen name for geologist Elsa Kirsten Peters. Such dizzying range makes the point that contemporary Quakers liberal, pastoral, evangelical can be mildly or wildly different despite common core beliefs in peace, simplicity, truth telling and ongoing divine revelation. At the same time it offers excerpts from such better known Quaker believers as James Michener and Richard Foster, the anthology introduces such unsung writers as children\'s book specialist Elfrida Vipont Foulds, one of a notably large cadre of women who have always been empowered in Quaker tradition to speak or write. Anthologies are necessarily arbitrary, acknowledges editor Bill, an Earlham College writing program graduate who provides helpful biographical introductions. Still, the influential writer-educator Parker Palmer should have been included.

Exploring the extent to which the literary culture of North America was shaped by a diverse range of influences, it addresses an issue of growing concern to scholars of American history and literature. Quixotic Fictions reaffirms the global reach of Cervantes\'s influence and explores the complex, contradictory ways in which Don Quixote helped shape American fiction at a formative moment in its development.', 'Quixotic Fictions of the USA 1792-1815', 'quixotic-fictions-of-the-usa-1792-1815'),
